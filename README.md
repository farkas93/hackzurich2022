## Motivation

Approximately 5-10% of world the world population is suffering from severe claustrophobia. This irrational fear of confined spaces affects their daily life. This can range from not being able to use an elevator to not beeing able to ride through a tunnel.
Klaus die Maus offers a safe exposure therapy environment. By monitoring the vital data of the patient, the therapy can be adjust and progress can be monitored.
For the safety of the patient the virtual environment will be reset if the vital parameters are reaching critical levels.

We strongly believe that every individual on this planet should have to chance to live a life without fear!
Our approach can be extended to fear of heights, fear of spiders, fear of presenting, fear of snakes and so on.

Let's empower the people to help them selfs.

## How?

Klaus die Maus uses the FitBit Versa 3 to monitor the health data of the patient.
To create an immersive experience we are using an Oculus Quest. The patient can dive into our virtual world and move as he wishes.
By walking into a tunnel we are trying to trigger the fear of the patient.
The monitored health data does influences the virtual therapy session.

## Why Klaus?

Our therapy environment can be adapted to individual needs of each patient. This leads to better results and unlimited therapies.

## Challanges we ran into

To collect the health data real time and synchronie it with the virutal environment was quite a challange.

## What's next?

Extend the pallett of treateable fears.
Improve the VR experience.
